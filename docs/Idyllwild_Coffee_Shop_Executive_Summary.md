# Idyllwild Coffee Shop Executive Summary
## One-Page Overview & Key Insights

**Date:** November 5, 2025
**Location:** Idyllwild, California (92549)

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

Idyllwild is a mile-high mountain resort town with **3,000-4,000 year-round residents** (median income **$83,205**) and **tens of thousands of annual tourists** from LA, San Diego, and Palm Springs (all within 2 hours). The coffee shop market has 6 existing venues, but all have critical weaknesses: inconsistent hours, poor customer service, no comfortable gathering spaces, and limited all-day options.

**Market Gap:** No coffee shop open consistently 6 AM to 7 PM, 7 days/week with quality products, excellent service, and comfortable "third place" environment.

---

## THE CONCEPT

A premium independent coffee shop that becomes Idyllwild's reliable community hub by filling the gaps competitors leave open. Locally-roasted coffee, full espresso bar, partnered pastries from local bakeries, and comfortable seating with WiFi for residents and tourists.

**Positioning:** "Your consistent, quality coffee destination with genuine mountain hospitality"

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

| Our Advantage | Competitor Weakness |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **6 AM - 7 PM, 7 days/week** | Alpaca closes at noon, Black Mountain closed 3 days/week, most close by 5 PM |
| **Exceptional service** | Higher Grounds has "attitude" complaints, Black Mountain turns away walk-ins |
| **Comfortable third place** | Most are takeout-focused with minimal seating |
| **Quality + convenience** | Black Mountain has quality but no espresso/terrible hours, Pure Bean convenient but inconsistent |
| **Transparent pricing** | Competitors don't publish prices, customers complain about value |

## WHAT MAKES THIS WORK

### The Numbers Add Up Because:
1. **Market demand exists** (6 venues already operating, residents + significant tourist traffic)
2. **Clear competitive gaps** (hours, service, environment)
3. **Affluent customer base** ($83k median income, educated, quality-focused)
4. **Multiple revenue drivers** (residents, tourists, events, outdoor recreation)
5. **Conservative projections** (200 trans/day = only 7% of resident coffee drinkers + modest tourist capture)
6. **Industry-standard margins** (30% COGS, 26% labor, 56% prime cost)
7. **Proven coffee shop model** (industry average $450-500k revenue for small independent shops)

### The Risks Are Manageable:
- Staffing: Pay well, owner can fill gaps
- Seasonality: Plan for it, build reserves
- Competition: Fill unmet needs, differentiate clearly
- Weather: Insurance, emergency fund
- Small market: Focus on quality over expansion

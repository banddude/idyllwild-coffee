## 🎯 The Opportunity

Idyllwild has 6 existing coffee shops, but **all have significant operational gaps**:

- **Alpaca Coffee:** Closes at noon (loses all afternoon/evening business)
- **Black Mountain:** No espresso drinks, closed 3 days/week, service issues
- **Higher Grounds:** Customer service complaints, dated aesthetic
- **Pure Bean:** Inconsistent quality despite good location

**The Market Gap:** No coffee shop open 6 AM - 7 PM, 7 days/week with quality products, excellent service, and comfortable gathering space.
